# AvlBst

This is my version of an AVL tree. I wanted a template so I could reuse it for future projects.
As long as the type has overloaded equality operators this tree should work. It still has some functionality 
that needs to be added. But, you can add create a tree, add objects, and see the order output and the tree size.
